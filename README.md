#Code Sharing Practices

Clone the main project to your computer, create a new project outside of the project folder. Then use that copy to do all of your code developing. (Follow these instructions to create your developing copy from the existing GitHub project.... https://unomaha.instructure.com/courses/71779/pages/pycharm-how-to-create-a-project-from-an-existing-github-project?module_item_id=2510884 )

When coding, before you start typing anything comment out a section above your code that will contain the following:

“Added after push ___”

The purpose of the code and what it does.

Any notes that will be useful for people to understand your code.

Your name and the date.

Make a note of all the files you updated/created/moved (I would recommend writing a list.) This is very important; the team needs to know exactly what's been added/updated/changed and exactly where those changes/updates were made.

Clone your development copy to GitHub and add all team members as collaborators. That way we can all easily share code with other team members.

Once your code has been reviewed and works without throwing any errors, the “Code Manager” will implement your code into the main project. In order to make this possible it is extremely important that you make note of all the changes you have made. So that the Code Manager can implement those changes/updates into the project and insert the code in the appropriate locations.

Once your code has been implemented into the project and it has been pushed into the main project by the Code Manager. Clone the project again to get all the new updates.

Make another copy of the new updates and use the new copy to do your code development. Do not keep working with your old copy as it will not have the necessary code. Do not delete your first copy or subsequent developing copies, they might come in handy at some point.
